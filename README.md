## Axe Accessibility

I did an Accessibility check on the project using [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe/). I attempted to address all errors. The only remaining accessibility issues that were not addressed were [text color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.0/color-contrast?application=AxeChrome) issues. Upon further investigation though, elements on the page that triggered this issue are text elements placed over an image. I choose to not address them in order to keep the final page as close to the mockup as possible.
